* As	a	tourist,	I	want to	have	interactive	maps	to	explore	the	place	I	am	in,	so	that I	can	find	
places	to	go	and	things	to	do	in	the	place	I	am	touring.

* As	a city	walker,	I	want to	see	directions	of	where	I	am	going	over	top	of	the	real	world,	so	that I	
can	see	where	I	am	supposed	to	go	based	upon	the	real	world.

* As	a curious	passerby,	I	want to	be	able	to	point	my	phone	camera	at	a	building	and	it	tell	me	
information	about	it, so	that I	do	not	have	to	go	through	the	work	of	googling	it.
