AR Maps is a mapping service built-in augmented reality. The goal is to allow a user to get to their destination while avoiding confusing directions. The path is drawn over a real-world objects so that the user has a better understanding of where they are. This will help to enhance the user's reality to improve their life. In addition to the mapping, we plan to include a landscape reference and information source service. This will allow the user to take a picture of the environment get some information related to the objects in it.
