### Background Description
 A mapping service that is built in alternate reality; you just need to point your phone up toward a street, building, anything around you and arrows will form showing you what way you need to go to reach your destination. You can also point it at buildings to figure out what businesses, stores, etc are located in that building.
 
### Problem Statement
Have you ever been walking around in a new city trying to figure out how to get to a certain location?
You pull out google maps and try to navigate yourself to your desired location. However, it is pretty difficult, the arrow telling you which way to go can be confusing if you are not currently on the road, the scale of the map seems off, and there is no way to tell if you are going the correct way as landmarks are not always shown.

### Inadequacy of current solutions
Current solutions that we found did not meet expectations for what this service could deliver.
Samsungs Bixby assistant has the ability to look at a building and tell what is in it based upon geolocation. However, this is limited to Samsung phones.

### Background skills/ interests applicable to the problem
- Previous expereince designing and working on iOS apps while on co-op at Trayak LLC. 
- I am very interested in new technology and alternate reality seems like it has the potential to take off.
- Helping tourists or people that just moved to a new place get used to their environment in a intuitive easy to use app.

### Approach to problem
- iOS application
- AR Kit (swift)
- using the devices camera to show generated directions over real life areas to then navigate the person to their desired location.

### Goals and Expectations
Goals include:
- succesfully providing navigation using alternate reality to make it easier for users to find places.
- rendering information of a building that the user is either walking by or pointing the phone at.

For the final product we expect to have a working app submited to the app store and to succesfully demonstrate the AR maping capabilities.
