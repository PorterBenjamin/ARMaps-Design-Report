# Project Sought
___
For what concerns my capstone, I would like to do something related to either virtual reality or crypto currency. The goal in virtual reality would be to create an environment where the user can move and interact with objects made through a 3D software, like CAD or 3DS Studio Max. The interest in cryptocurrency is more ambitious. Matter of fact, I would like to create a new cryptocurrency that might be used in the future for specific transactions within universities or an app that can perform crypto currency mining.
